```bash
# Summarize a URL
summarize https://example.com/article

# Summarize a YouTube video (extracts transcript)
summarize https://youtube.com/watch?v=...

# Summarize a local file
summarize document.pdf

# With custom model
summarize --model gpt-4o https://example.com/article
```

## Trigger Phrases

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- "Summarize this URL/article/page"
- "What does this link say?"
- "Transcribe this YouTube video"
- "Extract text from this PDF"

## Installation
